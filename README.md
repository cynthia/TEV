# Implementation for _Triangulation embedding and democratic aggregation for image search_

## TODO
1. Write matlab code to compute covariance matrix, its inverse, and PCA
1. Need a good K-Means wrapper (maybe in MATLAB also)
1. Write TEV only for vector generation, in C++

## Issues
1. icpc test.cpp -mkl
1. source /usr/usc/intel/default/setup.csh
